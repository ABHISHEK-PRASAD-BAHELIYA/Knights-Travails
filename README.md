# Knights-Travails
The Knight's Travails problem involves finding the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a starting position to a target position. Using the knight's unique "L" shaped moves, the goal is to determine the minimum number of moves required. This problem is typically solved using a breadth-first search algorithm.
